	<h1 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h1>

	<h3 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">1.  The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? 
			</h3>

			<h3 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?
			</h3>

		<p1 class="p1" style="font-family: Arial;">
			1. The article “The Programmed Designer” argues that software and products such as Adobe and Apple have established themselves as the “universal” tools and possess great political dominance in the design world. Due to their standard interfaces and workflows which have become the norm among creatives, and ceaseless growth of their algorithms -as they gradually control more and more design decisions- the artists and designers are predominantly viewed as mere consumers and no longer have a clear grasp over the tools which their career identities and creativity depends on. From both a practical and political view, this article discusses OSPs as an opportunity for designers to recapture their freedom of thinking and creating, unrestrained by the marketing and branding of companies such as Adobe and Apple. 
			“Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders” also agree that in the world of developers and programming, OSPs allow certain flexibility for their users and disregard the copyright laws forced upon them. However, in contrast, It showcases the acceptance and push for the use of open sources amid the developers to further progress in the industry. Even said, GitHub, known to be an organizing and socializing platform for these open sources and programmers was acquired by Microsoft, which displays how easily the larger corporations can again dominate the tools the creators use. Thus, similar to the issues with adobe, the shared spaces, interfaces, and workflows amongst the people in the industry are again retained by digital capitalism which disconnects the developers and designers from their instruments. This article suggests a progressive development of the “democratic tech sector” where creators and coders can maintain smaller businesses with higher quality as a way to stay away from the loop of the cheap and fast promises of the bigger corporations.

			2. Other than the required digital tools and programs, as a designer in a fast, demanding, and constantly altering industry, I think that networking and problem solving are two important skills that are integral to the design practice. I do consider non-digital tools and crafts as a great way to develop independence from the programs and for oneself but the ability to easily reach out, receive constructive criticism, and encounter new challenges that develop our proficiency in a conceptual manner come hand in hand with any other required tools to grow as a designer.

			<h1 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">Reading Discussion II:Olia Lialina</h1>
			<h3 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">1. What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. 
			</h3>
			<h3 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).
			</h3>

			<p class="p1" style="font-family: Arial;">
			1.    Olia Lialina defines the “Universal User” as someone that has the ability to maintain their workflows and everyday needs without reliance on a specific software or application/tool dedicated to that task. Earlier, the author mentions that UX designers and the overall path of the Experience design are gradually blending the lines between people and computers and their “primary goal” is to make these interfaces disappear and make the “experience” easier for the “busy users”, which also dematerializes these tools and applications and creates a dependency that has major control over our lives. This fact also underlines the importance of the term “users” itself, in order to create enough distinction and maintain a boundary. Liliana mentions that a Universal user is a mindset and the capacity to become one is in all of us. I have to agree that for designers especially, it becomes a “conscious decision” to avoid using specific software dedicated to their tasks in order to create further engagement in their design directives, and these decisions have the potential to become healthy habits in one’s workflow, involvement, and visibility as users. Additionally, this is also an appropriate category for understanding Schwulst’s argument. Similar to Liliana’s example of a website that acknowledges its users and “addresses them as a part of their workflow” (“Google Maps + Google Video + Mashup — Claude Lelouch’s Rendezvous” made in 2006), Schwulst also agrees that in order to create a better engagement and transform the web for it to work for “us” the users, we could possibly take a similar approach to the origins of this “user employment” and the web by becoming the creators of the “world” which we create by having our own individual platforms as websites.

			<p class="p1" style="font-family: Arial;">
			2.    I see myself as a somewhat habitual or rather partially conscious Universal User. Even though I use a significant portion of the mainstream and general interfaces in my workflow in order to do certain tasks and stay connected with other users, I can confidently say that I do not depend on such tools in order to attain my goals and make ends meet, in other words, I am to be considered a user that is able to “achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device”. Additionally, as an artist who has attempted to maintain a personal website before and contribute to this world-building idea, my experience can be described as a “website as a plant” which is slowly but surely moving towards a more confident and accepting place from mostly a personal perspective.
