	<h3 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">Select one of the three questions on the last slide of Part 1 of the lecture to respond to (regarding integrating embodiment into the design process). Try to be detailed and specific, giving concrete examples of how you would approach this task.

			In order to employ more of an embodied experience in the everyday design practice: one of the steps that can cultivate further progress into this complex system is the depth of our research and how much we are willing to consider the ethical and cultural aspects and qualities of what we choose to reference and achieve in our process. For example, in order to familiarize ourselves with new styles, genres, while searching for new inspirations, rather than doing surface level research and creating a “purely visual reference board” we can achieve new depths in our design by acknowledging the historical factors and origins of the same results we receive with basic research. 
			Another way that we can achieve a more complex embodied experience is to further allow our environment to influence how we approach a new project or our perspective which can open doors/ paths to many other variables which make our designs curated towards a wider variety of audiences. Similar to the example used in the lecture, the basic act of ordering food on your phone as a consumer can be interconnected and branched out to many other environmental elements and create a broader cycle of experiences, affiliated with a much bigger and varied population of users/ audiences, hence a better/more easily communicated design.
