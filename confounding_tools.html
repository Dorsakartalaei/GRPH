</h1>

<p1 style="font-family: Arial;">
	1. The article “The Programmed Designer” argues that software and products such as Adobe and Apple have established themselves as the “universal” tools and possess great political dominance in the design world. Due to their standard interfaces and workflows which have become the norm among creatives, and ceaseless growth of their algorithms -as they gradually control more and more design decisions- the artists and designers are predominantly viewed as mere consumers and no longer have a clear grasp over the tools which their career identities and creativity depends on. From both a practical and political view, this article discusses OSPs as an opportunity for designers to recapture their freedom of thinking and creating, unrestrained by the marketing and branding of companies such as Adobe and Apple. 
“Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders” also agree that in the world of developers and programming, OSPs allow certain flexibility for their users and disregard the copyright laws forced upon them. However, in contrast, It showcases the acceptance and push for the use of open sources amid the developers to further progress in the industry. Even said, GitHub, known to be an organizing and socializing platform for these open sources and programmers was acquired by Microsoft, which displays how easily the larger corporations can again dominate the tools the creators use. Thus, similar to the issues with adobe, the shared spaces, interfaces, and workflows amongst the people in the industry are again retained by digital capitalism which disconnects the developers and designers from their instruments. This article suggests a progressive development of the “democratic tech sector” where creators and coders can maintain smaller businesses with higher quality as a way to stay away from the loop of the cheap and fast promises of the bigger corporations.

2. Other than the required digital tools and programs, as a designer in a fast, demanding, and constantly altering industry, I think that networking and problem solving are two important skills that are integral to the design practice. I do consider non-digital tools and crafts as a great way to develop independence from the programs and for oneself but the ability to easily reach out, receive constructive criticism, and encounter new challenges that develop our proficiency in a conceptual manner come hand in hand with any other required tools to grow as a designer.
