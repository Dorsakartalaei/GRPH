	<h3 style="font-family: 'Cinzel Decorative';">Many of the tools and languages mentioned by Just van Rossum in the talk are open-source in nature. Find 3 other unique languages/software/tools that are open source. Describe how you could apply open source principles to your design process.

			Open-source software, as their title suggests, allow their developers and user to freely modify, develop, and grasp their workflows and tools. Consequently, regarding Design as a moderately fanned out and contemporary field of the arts -which embodies technological advancements-, open-source software is a step back towards better results and progression of design’s future. The three following software have each been rather evidently developed for a certain area of design, however, the user process showcases how capable such software are of reassembling themselves into better tools. For instance, FontForge is a free/open-source software that implements coding languages such as python and allows the users to render and edit fonts. Furthermore, Inkscape is another open-source vector graphics software that is recognized as a common replacement for adobe software such as illustrator or photoshop with the addition of free access to further development and distribution. Lastly, OpenScad is another open-source, script-based software that creates 3D CAD (computer-aided design) models with the incorporation of coding languages such as C++. Overall, Open-source tools as such, conceptually create an environment/community for their users to invite more feedback and constructive development to their designs. Similarly, such collaborative principles and culture can be a beneficial addition to one’s design process and comprehending the value of our products. It is important to state that the knowledge required for the furtherment of these principles amongst designers is not easily achieved or accessible. Even said, one of the ways which we can step out of our repetitive practices is to dedicate more time to the understanding of how our tools work or employ ideas that cannot necessarily be achieved using the mainstream interfaces available to us but rather dismantling and reconstructing the purpose of devices and instruments according to our needs.
