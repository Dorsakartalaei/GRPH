				For this assignment I decided to
				take a more conteptual and overal
				non-narrative route.
				Over the pandemic, I became
				more aware of the significance of
				time and unintentional idling.
				Additionally, I gradually became
				more intersted in astronomy and
				the concept of spacetime, and its
				various symbolisms.
				In order to combine the two concept,
				I decided to collect space
				images using a 3D moon simulator
				software. However still limited,
				the application allowed me
				to freely explore different angles
				and dynamics in order to collect
				enough data to begin the design
				process.
				My main goal at this stage was
				to maintain enough texture and
				variations while collecting the
				images since I was still unaware
				of the limitations of my tools and
				softwares.

		For the first stage of this assignment, I mainly experimented with the textural aspect of my data and
		aimed to test the flexibility of my tools. In this series of compositions, I used principles such as repetition
		and direction as a way to transform my images and data into a paintbrush. Additionally, my
		goal here was to achieve cycles/patterns that showcase the iteration of time during the pandemic,
		and eventually to be used as elements within the final layout.

		I used google docs as my main canvas and tool for this assignment which gives slightly more advanced
		options to its users to be able to adjust the levels and pictorial dynamics of their images.
		Accordingly, I used images that I had created in the previous stage in various orders and directions,
		and by editing the transparency and contrast I tried to achieve more depth and profundity which
		due to the limitations of my tools was however unsuccessful.

			<img class="pat5" src="images/pat5.jpg" alt="pat5">

			<p class="p3" style= "line-height: 200%; font-family: Arial;">
		Furthermore, another method I experimented with was the use of my previously composed images
		as paintbrushes themselves. As seen in some compositions, again by using repetition and direction
		I attempted to arrange those elements in a way that they are seen as one particle/ shape.
